# What's this about?

Look I was checking react-vr, react-360, aframe-react, aframe-gui and a few others and they're either not maintained since forever or very limited and not very customiseable.

And like every good geek my first thought was: "how hard can it be, I'll do it myself"

So I'll try to update this page as I go.

# Where is this at?

You can see a [demo here](https://pitilezard.github.io/aframe-react-gui/), but here is my rough todolist

-   ✅ Take the Responsive UI example and make it work locally on its own
-   ✅ Turn this into a modern ESM based app
-   ✅ Reactify some parts of it in a way that makes sense.
-   🚧 Get to a point where everything feels like using a normal MUI type library
-   ❌ Create ways to access an automatic layout of panels around you
-   ❌ Create a FlexContainer and GridContainer to help with building UI's
-   ❌ Create a basic set of customiseable components
-   ❌ Extend component set and customiseability
-   ❌ Build an actual app!

# My challenges

## So far

Balancing the way aframe work with the way we're used to build apps in React.

## Yet to overcome

Understanding aframe/threejs. I'm doing things that work but I don't understand them yet.

The good thing is I think that the vision I have for this is actually possible. If it works, it'll help a lot of people to get onboard with building a VR website for their ecosystem.
